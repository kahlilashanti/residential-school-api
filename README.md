View their Interactive Map, where they have mapped out the locations of the residential schools and added links to Archives for each school, here:

The information in this API was compiled using information from the following resources:

https://nctr.ca/ for the names, locations and open/close dates of the residential schools

https://www.findlatitudeandlongitude.com/ was used to find latitude and longitude when/if available

https://www.canadapost-postescanada.ca/info/mc/personal/postalcode/fpc.jsf to find post codes when/if available

Some of the locations do not have post codes and some of the location names no longer exist.

Nobody asked me to compile this information.  I wanted to do something to help.  Please use the API resources respectfully and in 

honor of those who were and are affected by this sensless tragedy.  May they rest in peace.

Between the 1870s and the 1990s, Canada's federal government took more than 150,000 First Nations, MÃ©tis and Inuit children from 

their families and forced them to attend church-run residential schools designed to assimilate them by stripping them of their own 

languages and cultures. 

A national inquiry revealed the extent of abuse and neglect the children faced in those schools. The Truth and Reconciliation (TRC) 

Commission of Canada has found evidence that 4,100 children died of disease, malnourishment, suicide and more, but says the true 

total is likely much higher. Many of those children remain unaccounted for.

In Canada, the Indian residential school system was a network of mandatory boarding schools for Indigenous peoples. The network was 

funded by the Canadian government's Department of Indian Affairs and administered by Christian churches.
